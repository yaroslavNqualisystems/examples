7.15.16. Frame Latency Distribution
This chart shows latency ranges on the Y axis.  The length of a colored bucket signifies its size relative to the total latency spread.  It does not correspond to the number of packets.
The latency buckets are generated each second to an ideal normal curve, real packet latencies should be close but not exactly normal.
Buckets are generated as - bucket1 (dark blue): lowest 2.2%; bucket2 (light blue): low 13.7%; bucket3 (green): middle 68.2%; bucket4 (light blue): high 13.7%; bucket5 (dark blue): highest 2.2%
68.2% of packets sent during the interval (ideally) will be in the middle bucket (green).
Layer 2 and 3 tests on 1Gig blades do not support dynamic latency.  These tests will have static 10,100,1000,10000,10000+ ms buckets.
